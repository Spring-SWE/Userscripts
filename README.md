# Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collectors Edition Checker


`I wrote this in a couple minutes so don't expect anything crazy here.`

This script will simply constantly check the status of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collectors Edition for you. This script was written really quickly so expect it to be updated over time to be a little more robust. I'll be working on it over the new few days but as of now, it works well enough.


## How It Works

1. Checks Nintendo for the status of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Collectors edition.
2. If the game `is not` available, it will check again in 30 seconds.
3. If the game `is` available, it will send a notification to your OS.

## Usage

### MAKE SURE DESKTOP NOTIFICATIONS ARE TURNED ON.
`Make sure you leave the gamepage OPEN in the background.`

1. Install TamperMonkey extension for your browser.
2. Copy the code from [above] into a new UserScript
3. browse to the [game] page
4. profit
